class AttributeFilter(object):
    # Apply filtering rules to attributes.
    #
    # Upon initialization, an AttributeFilter object will take all attribute
    # related settings and turn them into an ordered tuple of
    # AttributeFilterRules. During registration of the agent, a single
    # AttributeFilter object will be created, and will remain unchanged for
    # the life of the agent run. Changing attribute related settings/rules
    # requires restarting the agent.
    #
    # Each attribute can belong to one or more destinations. To determine
    # which destination an attribute belongs to, call the apply() method,
    # which will apply all of the rules to the attribute and return a set of
    # destinations.
    #
    # Destinations are represented as bitfields, where the bit positions
    # specified in the DST_* constants are used to indicate which
    # destination an attribute belongs to.
    #
    # The algorithm for applying filtering rules is as follows:
    #
    #   1. Start with a bitfield representing the set of default destinations
    #      passed in to apply().
    #
    #   2. Mask this bitfield against the set of destinations that have
    #      attribute enabled at all.
    #
    #   3. Traverse the list of AttributeFilterRules in order, applying
    #      each matching rule, but taking care to not let rules override the
    #      enabled status of each destination. Each matching rule may mutate
    #      the bitfield.
    #
    #   4. Return the resulting bitfield after all rules have been applied.
