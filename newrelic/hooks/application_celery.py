        #      have been invoked, this task may be called in the context
        #      of an inactive transaction. In this case, don't wrap the task
        #      in any way. Just run the original function.
        #
        #   2. In an active transaction
        #
        #      Run the original function inside a FunctionTrace.
        #
        #   3. Outside of a transaction
        #
        #      This is the typical case for a celery Task. Since it's not
        #      running inside of an existing transaction, we want to create
        #      a new background transaction for it.

    # Celery tasks that inherit from celery.app.task must implement a run()
    # method.
    # ref: (http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/2.5/reference/
    #                            celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.BaseTask)
    # Celery task's __call__ method then calls the run() method to execute the
    # task. But celery does a micro-optimization where if the __call__ method
    # was not overridden by an inherited task, then it will directly execute
    # the run() method without going through the __call__ method. Our
    # instrumentation via ObjectWrapper() relies on __call__ being called which
    # in turn executes the wrapper() function defined above. Since the micro
    # optimization bypasses __call__ method it breaks our instrumentation of
    # celery. To circumvent this problem, we added a run() attribute to our
    # ObjectWrapper which points to our __call__ method. This causes Celery
    # to execute our __call__ method which in turn applies the wrapper
    # correctly before executing the task.
    #
    # This is only a problem in Celery versions 2.5.3 to 2.5.5. The later
    # versions included a monkey-patching provision which did not perform this
    # optimization on functions that were monkey-patched.
