    # Celery tasks that inherit from celery.app.task must implement a run()
    # method.

    #                            celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.BaseTask)
    # Celery task's __call__ method then calls the run() method to execute the
    # task. But celery does a micro-optimization where if the __call__ method
    # was not overridden by an inherited task, then it will directly execute
    # the run() method without going through the __call__ method. Our
    # instrumentation via FunctionWrapper() relies on __call__ being called which
    # in turn executes the wrapper() function defined above. Since the micro
    # optimization bypasses __call__ method it breaks our instrumentation of
    # celery.
    #
    # For versions of celery 2.5.3 to 2.5.5+
    # Celery has included a monkey-patching provision which did not perform this
    # optimization on functions that were monkey-patched. Unfortunately, our
    # wrappers are too transparent for celery to detect that they've even been
    # monky-patched. To circumvent this, we set the __module__ of our wrapped task
    # to this file which causes celery to properly detect that it has been patched.
    #
    # For versions of celery 2.5.3 to 2.5.5
    # To circumvent this problem, we added a run() attribute to our
    # FunctionWrapper which points to our __call__ method. This causes Celery
    # to execute our __call__ method which in turn applies the wrapper
    # correctly before executing the task.
