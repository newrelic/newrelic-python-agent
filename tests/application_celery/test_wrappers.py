    """
    Tests that worker optimizations do not remove New Relic instrumentation.

    Previously, New Relic was applying instrumentation hooks to `Task`/`BaseTask`.
    Setting up and resetting worker optimizations were removing the instrumentation
    so, instrumentation was created to remove the instrumentation, run the worker
    optimizations, and then reapply the instrumentation.

    The purpose of the worker optimizations is to circumvent an issue where a
    custom task class defines `__call__` and also calls `super().__call__`.

    We can ensure that the instrumentation is preserved for the `add_with_super` task.
